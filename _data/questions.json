This communication is best accomplished one-on-one when the child is awake and alert.",
        "For that reason we pride ourselves on being able to work with a wide range of children even those that are reluctant, fearful or physically or mentally compromised without the need for mind altering drugs or sedation."

      "question": "Why do you make the parents wait in the waiting room away from the child?",
      "answers": [
        "Children can sense their parent's discomfort. That is the reason why we prefer to meet the children away from their parents so that we can relate on a one-to-one basis with the child. The parent's presence in the treatment area, although intended to provide comfort to the child, instead indicates that the mom or dad is there to provide protection against these &quot;strangers.&quot; In some cases, treatment can be seriously hindered."

        "Be aware of lunchtime food programs at your child's school and monitor what kinds of food they're consuming both for their overall and dental health. If possible recommend rinsing with water after lunch or even better, bring a toothbrush! Homework and studying can cause stress even on younger children as schools get more competitive, bringing with it snacking at odd times and juice or other drinks that can cause staining and cavities. Suggest more healthy snacks such as popcorn, nuts, or fruit rather than packaged processed foods and drinks. Please ask us if you have additional concerns. We're happy to answer any questions you may have."

      "question": "Why should I fix a baby tooth if it’s just going to fall out later? Are they really that important?",
      "answers": [
        "Baby teeth are there for a reason. They not only allow the child teeth to chew their food with, but also give proper space to their other teeth and a path for their permanent teeth to grow into. If a tooth is lost too early from an accident or due to a cavity, we may need to install a space maintainer to allow space for the new tooth to grow into. Often times, it's easier and less expensive to just repair the baby tooth."

      "question": "When should my child wear a Mouth Guard?",
      "answers": [
        "We generally recommend that a soft plastic mouth guard should be used to protect a child's teeth, lips, and cheeks from injuries during sports-related activities. During any sports based activity where there is risk of head, face or neck injury. Such sports include Hockey, Soccer, Karate, Basketball, Baseball, Skating, Skateboarding, as well as many other sports. Most oral injuries occur when children play basketball, baseball and soccer. If your child plays contact sports, we can create a custom fitted mouth guard for this purpose."

      "question": "What age is the right age for orthodontics?",
      "answers": [
        "Pediatric dentists are trained to monitor and evaluate growth and development of the teeth and supporting bone structure. As your child grows we will determine when orthodontic intervention is necessary. Every child is different and has different needs. Some children are in need of early orthodontic treatment (phase I) to help modify growth and development. Phase I can include retainers, expanders and headgear. Other children can wait for traditional braces (phase II) when they have all their permanent teeth."
