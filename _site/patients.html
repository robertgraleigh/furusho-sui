					<p>For some children and parents, the first visit to the dentist can be a stressful situation. First, we establish trust between the child in an effort to set a positive tone for the rest of your child's life with their dentist. We meet with the child one-on-one so that the child may be introduced to the dentist and her team without the parent. While the parent may feel like their presence in the treatment area is comforting, actually the opposite is true. The child may feel like the parent is there to protect them from these “strangers” and cause undue discomfort and anxiety to the child.</p>

					<p>We then will implement the “show-tell-do” method to introduce the child to first things they know like a toothbrush, then to the other dental implements in a way that’s been proven to help them explore the process in a comfortable way. An open and honest dialogue helps the child to feel comfortable and know what to expect during any treatments. We never use sedative drugs or anesthesia as our goal is to have a well-adjusted child that is not afraid of the dentist. Even children on the spectrum or who may have disabilities can benefit from this nurturing learning atmosphere.</p>

            <p class="qa__answer transition hidden">Our highest priority for all of our patients is centered on comfort, safety, education and positive results. Regardless of the specific plan for treatment of the teeth, the focus for the doctors and the assistants is always on using our faces, our voices and our reassuring chairside manner to better communicate. This communication is best accomplished one-on-one when the child is awake and alert.</p>

That is the reason why we prefer to meet the children away from their parents so that we can relate on a one-to-one basis with the child. The parent's presence in the treatment area, although intended to provide comfort to the child, instead indicates that the mom or dad is there to provide protection against these &quot;strangers.&quot; In some cases, treatment can be seriously hindered.</p>

If possible recommend rinsing with water after lunch or even better, bring a toothbrush! Homework and studying can cause stress even on younger children as schools get more competitive, bringing with it snacking at odd times and juice or other drinks that can cause staining and cavities. Suggest more healthy snacks such as popcorn, nuts, or fruit rather than packaged processed foods and drinks. Please ask us if you have additional concerns. We're happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>

          <div class="content">
            
            <p class="qa__answer transition hidden">Baby teeth are there for a reason. They not only allow the child teeth to chew their food with, but also give proper space to their other teeth and a path for their permanent teeth to grow into. If a tooth is lost too early from an accident or due to a cavity, we may need to install a space maintainer to allow space for the new tooth to grow into. Often times, it's easier and less expensive to just repair the baby tooth.</p>

            <p class="qa__answer transition hidden">We generally recommend that a soft plastic mouth guard should be used to protect a child's teeth, lips, and cheeks from injuries during sports-related activities. During any sports based activity where there is risk of head, face or neck injury. Such sports include Hockey, Soccer, Karate, Basketball, Baseball, Skating, Skateboarding, as well as many other sports. Most oral injuries occur when children play basketball, baseball and soccer. If your child plays contact sports, we can create a custom fitted mouth guard for this purpose.</p>

            <p class="qa__answer transition hidden">Pediatric dentists are trained to monitor and evaluate growth and development of the teeth and supporting bone structure. As your child grows we will determine when orthodontic intervention is necessary. Every child is different and has different needs. Some children are in need of early orthodontic treatment (phase I) to help modify growth and development. Phase I can include retainers, expanders and headgear. Other children can wait for traditional braces (phase II) when they have all their permanent teeth.</p>

					<p>Our office was designed for infants, children and teens. From the arcade games in the waiting room to the life-sized wall art, kids feel right at home. It's a unique atmosphere that helps children relax and enjoy their experience. Children deserve to experience a gentle, caring approach to their dental care.</p>

					<p>Our goal is to help your child grow into an adult who routinely and comfortably seeks dental care. This often requires extra time with your child, distraction through many of our child friendly amenities, or in some cases the use of appropriate sedatives. It is very important to discuss with one of our doctors any bad experiences or fears your child may have in order to provide the best possible care for your child.</p>
