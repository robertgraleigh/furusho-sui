He loooooves going to the dentist and I'm so grateful. We've seen both dentists (I think there's only two in the practice?) and they're both very kind.</p>

            <p class="reviews__review">This practice is amazing. My son has special needs and in the past we've had to have him anesthatized or I've attempted to coax him into getting care. Here they don't believe in sedation and they NEVER make the parents intervene. So far, for my child who was never previously able to sit still for so much as a fluoride treatment they've: -Taken x-rays -Filled a tooth -Sealed four teeth They also call back after the appointment to check in. Lovely staff, great practice.</p>

            <p class="reviews__review">We took our 1.5 and 2.5 year old kids here for their first visit to the dentist. We immediately felt at ease and were warmly welcomed by the office staff. There were toys for the kids to play with and even though my little boy went back in tears, in no time at all he was sitting comfortable in the chair and getting his teeth cleaned... I would highly recommend this dental office for anyone looking for a pediatric dentist.</p>

I think these dentists take a very no nonsense but calm and loving approach to dentistry, which is exactly how it should be.</p>

            <p class="reviews__review">I found this office through Children's Memorial Hospital as one of the dentists is part of Children's Cleft Team. Now both my children use Dentistry for kids. Dr. Kohlman is a caring dentist who takes the time to explain his findings and plans to both the child and the parents. Further the front desk staff is polite and professional and the waiting area has plenty of things to keep your kids busy on the off-chance you have a small wait.</p>
