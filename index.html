					<p class="reviews__review">I was myself always a little bit skeptical about dentists. When I was looking for a dentist for our girls, I had to make sure first, that it was an attractive and fun place... Very friendly staff.</p>

					<p class="reviews__review">My older son is a sweet guy... but a big scardy cat. I had MUCH anxiety about his first dentist visit two years ago. Turns out, I had no reason to fear. He loooooves going to the dentist and I'm so grateful. We've seen both dentists (I think there's only two in the practice?) and they're both very kind.</p>

					<p class="reviews__review">This practice is amazing. My son has special needs and in the past we've had to have him anesthatized or I've attempted to coax him into getting care. Here they don't believe in sedation and they NEVER make the parents intervene. So far, for my child who was never previously able to sit still for so much as a fluoride treatment they've: -Taken x-rays -Filled a tooth -Sealed four teeth They also call back after the appointment to check in. Lovely staff, great practice.</p>

					<p class="reviews__review">My 4 year old loves it here to the point that when I had to cancel an appointment, he was upset and insisted that he wanted to go to the dentist that day!... I'm so glad we found this place as I had really hoped to find a dentist that my son didn't mind going to. Lucky for us, he actually loves it there.</p>

					<p class="reviews__review">Great pediatric dentist office!  I've been taking my son here for over 10 years now.  The staff is very kind and respectful...  I highly recommend this office for your child.</p>

					<p class="reviews__review">We took our 1.5 and 2.5 year old kids here for their first visit to the dentist. We immediately felt at ease and were warmly welcomed by the office staff. There were toys for the kids to play with and even though my little boy went back in tears, in no time at all he was sitting comfortable in the chair and getting his teeth cleaned... I would highly recommend this dental office for anyone looking for a pediatric dentist.</p>

					<p class="reviews__review">We drive over 40 miles (and past another 40 ped. dentists) to go here.  They are the only pediatric dentists we have found that use no anesthesia...  I think these dentists take a very no nonsense but calm and loving approach to dentistry, which is exactly how it should be.</p>

					<p class="reviews__review">My kids love coming here.  Really, they do!  Everyone is so friendly, from the front desk to the dentists (we've seen Drs Berman and Furusho).  True, they don't let parents in the back during the cleanings or exams, but fortunately my kids have handled this well and hopefully will continue to.</p>

					<p class="reviews__review">I found this office through Children's Memorial Hospital as one of the dentists is part of Children's Cleft Team. Now both my children use Dentistry for kids. Dr. Kohlman is a caring dentist who takes the time to explain his findings and plans to both the child and the parents. Further the front desk staff is polite and professional and the waiting area has plenty of things to keep your kids busy on the off-chance you have a small wait.</p>
